# Basic usage

## Image

The basilica of _Santi Cosma e Damiano_ is a titular church in Rome, Italy. The lower portion of the building is accessible through the Roman Forum and incorporates original Roman buildings, but the entrance to the upper level is outside the Forum. The circular building located at the entrance of the Forum, which now houses a small archeological exhibit, was built in the early 4th century as a Roman temple. It is thought to have been dedicated to Valerius Romulus, deified son of the emperor Maxentius. The main building was perhaps the library of an imperial forum.[^1]

## Map

This section still utilizes the Dutch map for the example painting as I do not have a geojson file prepped for Rome. Il Foro Romano is located precisely at 41°53'32"N, 12°29'7"E.
