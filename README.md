## Black-eyed Peas

Black-eyed peas or cowpeas (_Vigna unguiculata_ L. Walp) are both an ancient crop and a food of the future. Also known as crowder pea, caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies and akkerboon in South Africa;[^ref1] its many names reflect its worldwide appeal. These nourishing, protein-rich, easily-grown <span eid="Q145909"> legumes </span> are closely related to mung beans, adzuki beans and bambara groundnuts.

## An easy, useful crop
Black-eyed peas grow best in semi-arid conditions, poor soils and with little help. They are heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. Grown since ancient times, these (mainly annual) leguminous plants (in the plant family Fabaceae) have now become a staple part of the diets of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is not just the seeds (the beans or peas as we call them) that are harvested however – the leaves and pods of this reliable plant are also edible and used as a vegetable, or can be used for cattle fodder or hay,[^ref2] and, being legumes, they also enrich the soil through the presence of around 21 different (bradyrhizobial) symbiotic <span eid="Q15098397"> nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules </span> on their roots.[^ref3]

## Food in the Deep Past

Genomic sequencing suggests that humans domesticated an earlier wild relative independently in two regions: in West Africa, with vegetation zones [1] that change based on latitude, and East Africa, with vegetation zones that change based on altitude. Even to the present day, <span eid="Q55613"> ecotones </span> are valuable sites for settlement because they allow for mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing and aquaculture, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, <span eid="Q397350"> agroforestry </span>, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.  Because black-eyed peas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are useful crops the whole year round!

By 1500 BCE, the black-eyed pea or cowpea had spread through North Africa and beyond: out to the Mediterranean, the Arabian peninsula, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.  The native range of the cowpea in Africa and its subsequent introduction across the world can be seen on this map.

## Early Modern History
As we’ve seen, black-eyed peas had been consumed for millennia, especially in the Mediterranean. Records of their consumption and use within Europe during the Middle Ages (roughly the fifth through to the fifteenth centuries), however, are relatively scarce. Humble beans, understood as a food for peasants and livestock, would have been considered subject matter too lowly for inclusion in the annals of history. Indeed, surviving historical documents, for example letters or works of art from this period, very often focus on the interests of wealthier individuals who would have thought themselves too refined to consume black-eyed peas. Since antiquity, the black-eyed pea has been a cultural marker of those who had or lacked social status. Ancient Roman chronicler Pliny wrote that priests should avoid eating the food for fear its rough nature would upset their delicate and finely attuned constitutions. He also notes that Pythagoreas and his followers did not eat black-eyed peas because they “believed the souls of the dead to be contained within" the dried beans.* Moreover, the stigma of eating dried foods, rather than fresh, further impinged the reputation of the bean and its eaters: while wealthy and socially powerful individuals could afford fresh foods, peasants relied upon cheaper dried foods. The nutritionally rich black-eyed pea was a thrifty food valued for its extensive shelf life, but this durability was judged a less desirable quality for refined palettes. The oft-repeated adage 'you are what you eat,' was the rule of the day; those who ate fresh foods were understood as the wiser and healther social elite, while the consumers of dried foods were understood as less intelligent, somewhat unhealthy agents of a rough and tumble lifestyle. Such ideas persisted into the early modern period and can be seen, for example, in Italian artist <span eid="Q7824"> Annibale Carracci's </span> painting _The Bean Eater_ (painted c. 1590), which depicts a man eating a bowl of black-eyed peas. Carracci's painterly style in this work, a collection of swiftly rendered and unblended brushstrokes that give the appearance of a rough surface, acknowledges the man's status: unrefined in dress and manners, he eats an entirely typical and humble meal of black-eyed peas. This depiction shows a familiar trope of peasant life and suggests the man and his food are perhaps unruly parts of late sixteenth-century Italy's deeply heirarchical and classist society. The beans, associated with excessive gas, also suggest the food and the person eating it might be disruptive to the social fabric they inhabit. Despite the fact that black-eyed peas had been a vital part of the Southern European diet and culture for centuries, they are here presented as both marginal and familiar, this form of othering is a glimpse of what was to come for the black-eyed pea.

Carraci was not the only artist to depict beans or peas. Throughout Europe, there are various artworks that took inspiration from peas (be it their leaves, their delicate blossoms, or their sinuous tendril-filled vines). The peas depicted, however, were not of the black-eyed variety, but rather verdant green peas considered domestic to Europe, such as the 'English green pea'. The plant became an emblem for love, fertility, and even lust. The fresh green pea, however, was also a foot for the elite, and they decorated their homes and gardens accordingly. In painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo's allegorical portrait of summertime (from 1573), a moment in the cycle of seasons when plants are at their most fertile, he uses a green peapod to represent a woman's smiling mouth with each tooth represented by a perfectly round pea, the spreading smile a literal show of abundance. Compared to Carraci's rought brushtrokes, Arcimboldo's work uses fine, brushwork to create a smooth surface akin to that of the round, hard vegtable rinds he depicts. Arcimboldo's paintings were made for wealthy Eropean aristocrats who would have delighted in the variety of plants (many of which they ate) contained within each painting, these works a veritable botanical garden rendered in human form. It would have been this same eschelon of patron that funded and maintained such gardens. In fact, Arcimboldo's most devoted patron, Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II oversaw from his seat of power in Vienna some of the finest botanical gardens in all of Europe.

Seventeenth-century virtuoso wood carver Grinling Gibbons produced beautifully elaborate carved wood panelling for British aristocracy, including King William and Queen Mary. The artist famously included a peapod nestled in many of his works, as his signature motif. Dutch painters of this period also produced lush still life paintings which featured all manner of flora and fauna. These paintings in part were meant to remind the visitor of life's fleeting abundance. In Jan Davidsz de Heem's painting _Vase of Flowers_, c. 1660, we see a sumptuous array of flowers with several peapods at the base of the vase. Four of the verdant green pods are closed but appear plump and full peas just ready for the eating, while another sallow pod has opened up and being eaten by glossy black ants. The artist reveals how quickly the abundance and luxury of a fresh green pea soon spoils. The painter's commentary might also be related to the pea's power to symbolize what was then understood as a form of moral ruin: peapods were synonymous with male genitalia and the term "shelling peas" became a euphamism for illicit sexual intercourse.* Thus the open (or shelled peapod) appears past its prime while its unshelled counterparts remain vibrantly green.

Images of black-eyed peas and other varieties of beans and peas dramatically shaped European understandings of the plant. The dramatic rise in the production and circulation of printed texts with images, beginning in the sixteenth century, alongside unprecedented global travel formed European ideas about the local and the foreign, and the ways in which close observation of the natural world could reveal the origins of a person, plant, or an animal. One result of this study was a shift in European attitudes toward the black-eyed pea. Despite the millennia-old European presence of the black-eyed pea, it was now understood there as an itinerant body. Informing such ideas were widely circulated printed books, often containing illustrations, written by European travellers visiting Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Their observations were soon understood throughout Europe as factual accounts of various peoples, places, and plants, though the information contained in these volumes was in reality not always accurate. For example, Dutchman Pieter de Marees’ 1602 book describing West Africa shows the black-eyed pea in a landscape which, while meant to represent Africa, is actually an imaginary setting. We see people alongside plants that while native to Africa would not have grown in such close proximity.* The viewer is meant to elide the black-eyed pea with Africa's geography and peoples, this distinction diminishing the crop's long history beyond Africa while also revealing Europe's increasingly myopic gaze upon the rest of the world. Other printed texts such as herbals or natural histories also reinforced the codification of plants based on their geographic origins.

## What's in a Name?
Although they were not a high status item by the time Carracci's peasant sat down for his meal, authors since ancient times have described black-eyed peas in texts on plants and the natural world. In European botany there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification. These changes in nomeclature also reveal emerging Euroean ideas about the local and the foreign. More recently, taxonomists have been re-classifying the genus _Vigna_ and today all cultivated black-eyed peas are grouped under _Vigna unguiculata_ subspecies _unguiculata_. However, it was well known by many common names throughout ancient Eurasia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike.

In fact, the black-eyed pea was one of thousands of organisms that crossed from Eurasia to the Americas or vice versa, a process referred to since the 1970s as the <span eid="Q767253"> ‘Columbian Exchange’</span>. The African cowpea is thought to have arrived in the Americas around 1500, though this has been the subject of much debate.* What is accepted, however, is that the black-eyed pea came to the Americas as a result of the trade of enslaved Africans. Black-eyed peas were one of the primary foodstuffs during the trans-Atlantic passage, these beans mixed with fatty oils and rancid meats and fed to captives. Englishman <span eid="Q310326"> Sir Hans Sloane </span> notes the pea in Jamaica around 1687 and created this plant specimen there as part of his large Jamaican herbarium. The black-eyed pea was in Virginia by at least 1666, and Florida by around 1700.

The hard labor of enslaved peoples ensured that the black-eyed pea or cowpea was grown and cultivated as a crop largely for livestock throughout the United States, most especially in the South. Black-eyed peas were also a fixture in gardens of enslaved peoples, these beans a hearty supplement to the meagre meals allotted on plantations. Black-eyed peas became “the third most important food crop produced on Carolina plantations between 1730 and 1776.”* <span eid="Q11812"> Thomas Jefferson </span> and <span eid="Q23"> George Washington </span> both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, and Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about growth and cultivation of the plant, which in a [letter of 1787](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-05-02-0442) he calls "small, and round black eyed Pease called the Gentlemans Pea". Jefferson considered the cultivation of peas a pursuit worthy of a gentleman, harkening back to European traditions which placed greater social and cultiral status on green peas. He held yearly pea growing contests, with the first man to produce a fresh pea was required to host a dinner for other genetlemen in the area. By the nineteenth century, black-eyed peas, however, achieved new cultural cache and graced the tables of the white ruling class. Enslaved cooks played an important role in bringing this food into rarefied homes.

Throughout the <span eid="Q8676"> Civil War </span>, black-eyed peas remained an important food throughout the southern U.S., while in the North they were associated with the practice of slavery and therefore deemed undesirable. In the late nineteenth century, American <span eid="Q2787508"> subsistence farmers </span> were encouraged to grow the black-eyed pea or cowpea even if their local climate meant they didn’t get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the U.S farming landscape. Noted American scientist and innovative proponet of crop rotations, <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span> – who was enslaved at birth in Missouri in 1864 and freed after the Civil War – urged farmers in the American South to plant black-eyed peas to help replenish soil depleted by cotton farming while also cultivating an easily grown grop that could help lift formerly enslaved peoples out of systemically reinforced poverty. He wrote of the plant, "The cow pea is rightfully looked upon by many as the poor man’s bank or mortgage-lifter ... It is a matter of much regret that every colored farmer in Macon County does not plant at least three acres in peas."* 
<param ve-iframe

A 'Farmers Bulletin' of 1920 gave specific official advice on [growing cowpeas](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiOMV1jWGiQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true) in the U.S. Black-eyed peas were, and still are, mainly grown in southern hotter states and California, as the warm, dry conditions are more favourable for bean production there.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, in Japan, a copy of the extraordinary 30-volume agricultural encyclopaedia _Seikei Zuetsu_ (written 1793-1804) was gifted to the German physician, botanist and plant collector <span eid="Q77140">Philipp von Siebold</span> in the 1820s. Siebold arrived in Nagasaki in 1823 and started a medical school there, but spent much of his spare time studying Japanese flora and creating his own botanical garden of Japanese plants.[^ref69] The _Seikei Zuetsu_ detailed 109 crops of southern Japan and inside its beautifully illustrated pages can be found the 'cowpea' – most probably showing _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp. _unguiculata_ cv.-gr. _sesquipedalis_ or the 'yard-long bean' which was and still is popular in Asia today.[^ref70] Its presence in this Japanese book of crops from 1800 shows how far the black-eyed pea had come and how its usefulness had been welcomed into many agricultural traditions.

Today, black-eyed peas are grown commercially in at least 33 countries,[^ref71] this widespread embrace of the bean uniting geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures. As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out, “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories.[^ref72] Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is useful to keep in mind for any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.[^ref73]

## Culinary History and Cultural Celebrations

Black-eyed peas are a staple of the <span eid="Q49042"> Southern American </span> diet and an iconic component of Black culinary history. The peas are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory bean and rice dishes, but perhaps they are most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s. <span eid="Q1763911"> Hoppin’ John </span> is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity.

Hoppin’ John’s symbolism is one of prosperity, but its origin is anything but. On brutal American plantations, enslaved workers created new meals from West African recipes and the crops they had access to in the New World. They grew black-eyed peas and other African crops in their subsistence gardens outside the long hours they were forced to labor in their enslaver’s fields. The white ruling class saw black-eyed peas as a lowly food meant to feed livestock and the enslaved. To them, the peas seemed to fit in alongside the pork scraps used to cook Hoppin’ John. [^ref78]

In addition to field labor, enslaved women were often made to cook for the planter’s family as well as their own. This is how African foodstuffs like the black-eyed pea, mustard, collard greens, etc. were introduced to, and eventually taken up by, the Southern diet at large. By the 19th century, white women began including Black recipes in their homemaker cookbooks, of course, without crediting the women who pioneered them. [^ref79][^ref80][^ref81]

Brazil’s national dish, <span eid="Q878189"> _feijoada completa_, </span> has a very similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed _feijoada_ out of very little. It was originally a simple but filling dish made with the black-eyed peas or black beans and discarded pork. Today, however, it is a complex and celebratory meal for every level of society, taking days to prepare and involving many more ingredients and side dishes. It is especially associated with Carnival and religious ceremonies, but simple beans and rice dishes are a national staple.[^ref82][^ref83]

For both Hoppin’ John and _feijoada completa_, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, as well as a symbol of unity across racial lines. However, that’s an overly simplistic view of a complex issue. Southern cooking especially can only be viewed as culturally unifying at the surface level. In reality, there is still much tension in questions of representation, ownership, class, race, and identity in Southern food and <span eid="Q555997"> Soul food,</span> with white perspectives usually being unjustly prioritized over Black ones.

## A Colonial Crop
Although black-eyed pea was not grown as a crop in Britain (it usually being far too cold and wet), its inclusion in the [Economic Botany Collection](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/collections/economic-botany-collection) of the <span eid="Q18748726"> Royal Botanic Gardens Kew </span> is telling.  Here, over a hundred different collections of [seeds](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/main_image.php?imageid=EBC_68901), pods, ‘fibre’ and even a [model](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/read_ecbot.php?catno=61536&search_term=vigna%20unguiculata&search_type=name&imagechecklist=Images) of black-eyed peas are kept, mean that it was obviously studied as a useful colonial crop plant. Donations are as diverse as from Nigeria, India, Laos, China and Japan, but also from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed such as the <span eid="Q5148408"> Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 </span>, the Japan/British Exhibition of 1910, the British Industries Fair of 1930, as well as the <span eid="Q10534945"> India Museum </span>, the Imperial Institute, the Jamaica Agricultural Society, and colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567"> Dr WB Baikie's </span> Niger Expedition of 1859. One undated individual collection was even donated by the HRH the Prince of Wales, from the ‘East Indies’.

## Modern production
Today, worldwide production of black-eyed peas or cowpeas is hard to estimate as cultivation is still mainly in the hands of small-holder farmers, but also because they are such a staple food that most harvests are used locally rather than being exported. However the FAO estimate around 7 million tonnes are produced annually. [^ref86] The centres of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s black-eyed pea crop.[^ref87] It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in many different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains such as sorghum and millet or rice.[^ref88] It is the third most important pulse worldwide, an important element of sustainable agriculture, and feeds hundreds of millions of people.

## A food of the future 
The black-eyed pea is an often-overlooked crop, but soon we may all be more familiar with it. Legumes are emerging as ‘foods of the future’ due to their very nature of being highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow. They will play an important part in future food security – providing food in a changing climate and will continue to help small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger and improve their livelihoods.[^ref89] As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, and as more people aim to eat less meat, legume crops such as black-eyed peas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.[^ref90]

One can view the growing diet culture and veganism of the West alongide this increased environmental awareness. In both contexts, black-eyed peas and other legumes are growing in status as a key cooking ingredient. There are hundreds of such recipes readily available online and in cookbooks. Some health-focused cookbooks are regional, aiming to transform, for example, traditional southern recipes like black-eyed peas with pork to leaner, lower-sodium alternatives. [^ref90] Others combine recipes across many cultures, like _The Great Vegan Bean Book_, which aims to give vegans more options for flavorful meatless protein. These types of cookbooks often marry recipes inspired by the American South with Indian, African, and Caribbean cuisines. [^ref91] [^ref92]

## Crop wild relatives
Even though black-eyed peas are considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic with climate change. Crop breeding can try to alleviate future potential issues and make black-eyed peas even more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015"> relatives </span> of the black-eyed pea may hold genes or genetic traits that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions, and perhaps be more pest-resistant.[^ref93] If these traits can be bred into commercial varieties then the black-eyed pea may be one of the answers to the many agricultural challenges of the future. Over recent decades significant resources have been put into researching black-eyed peas and their potential. The Crop Wild Relatives Project is one such project in partnership with 33 countries [^ref94] and global seed banks including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and <span eid="Q2603353"> Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank </span>. There are currently eleven primary wild relatives of the black-eyed pea are being researched. Southern and western Africa are hotspots for wild black-eyed pea genetic variation. The importance of such relatives demonstrates how vital it is to protect wild plants and wild habitats for the future. In a telling [quote](https://www.cwrdiversity.org/cowpea/) from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be _an unfailing friend_ even while the climate crisis is affecting production.”
