## Black-eyed Peas

Black-eyed peas or cowpeas (_Vigna unguiculata_ L. Walp) are both an ancient crop and a food of the future. Also known as crowder pea, caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies and akkerboon in South Africa; its many names reflect its worldwide appeal. These nourishing, protein-rich, easily-grown <span eid="Q145909"> legumes </span> are closely related to mung beans, adzuki beans and bambara groundnuts.

## A pea by many names
The recording of these many monikers reveals much about the pea’s widespread use as well as the history of botanical study and its formation within various colonial empires. In European botany there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification. <span eid="Q1043"> Linnaeus (L.) </span>  gave this plant the scientific name _Dolichos unguiculatus_ in his <span eid="Q849308"> _Species Plantarum_ </span> of 1753 from a specimen from Barbados, but this African plant was formally renamed in 1974 as _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp._unguiculata_. However, it was well known as the cowpea throughout ancient Europe and Asia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike.

## An easy, useful crop
Cowpeas grow best in semi-arid conditions, poor soils and with little help. They are heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. Grown since ancient times, these (mainly annual) leguminous plants (in the plant family Fabaceae) have now become a staple part of the diets of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is not just the seeds (the beans or peas as we call them) that are harvested however – the leaves and pods of this reliable plant are also edible and used as a vegetable, or can be used for cattle fodder or hay, and, being legumes, they also enrich the soil through the presence of around 21 different (bradyrhizobial) symbiotic <span eid="Q15098397"> nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules </span> on their roots.

## Food in the Deep Past <!--images needed?-->
Genomic sequencing suggests that humans domesticated an earlier wild relative independently in two regions: in West Africa, with vegetation zones [1] that change based on latitude, and East Africa, with vegetation zones that change based on altitude. Even to the present day, <span eid="Q55613"> ecotones </span> are valuable sites for settlement because they allow for mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing and aquaculture, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, <span eid="Q397350"> agroforestry </span>, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.  Because cowpeas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are useful crops the whole year round!

Plant biologists look at the genetic structure of different specimens to determine how closely related they are. Specialists in <span eid="Q190375"> historical linguistics </span> have applied a similar technique to language families. Today, over 500 Bantu languages are spoken by hundreds of millions of people across Southern Africa as the result of a process historians call the <span eid="Q130251"> Bantu Expansions </span>. Comparing today’s languages with each other lets scientists reconstruct the languages of the past. Watch as the root for ‘cowpea,’ kunde, appears in languages across the continent.

By 1500 BCE this unfailing friend had spread through North Africa and beyond: out to the Mediterranean, the Arabian peninsula, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Ancient Greek physician <span eid="Q297776"> Dioscorides’ herbal _De Materia Medica_ </span> dubs the cowpea "phasiolos". This name referred to any sort of bean or pea (these terms used interchangeably in Dioscorides' time). <!--image of de Materia Media?-->

## Early Modern History

As we’ve seen, cowpeas had been consumed for millennia, especially in the Mediterranean, but many Northern European botanists were somewhat uninformed about the plant, their knowledge based on others’ descriptions or on specimens entering their collection in unfamiliar conditions. Flemish Botanist <span eid="Q333372"> Carolus Clusius’s </span> influential 1601 _Rariorum Plantarum Historia_ (History of Rare Plants), for example, refers to cowpea as _Phaseolus peregrinus IIII_. This connoted a bean from the Americas considered foreign to Europe (peregrinus meaning stranger or foreigner, from the Latin _peregre_, literally per- ‘through’ + ager ‘field').Despite the millennia-old European presence of the cowpea, it was now understood there as an itinerant body. Informing such ideas was Dutchman Pieter de Marees’ 1602 book describing West Africa, which included an image of the black-eyed pea growing in the landscape.* Italian artist <span eid="Q7824"> Annibale Carracci's </span> painting _The Bean Eater_, which depicts a peasant eating a bowl of black-eyed peas, also acknowledges the cowpea's status as both familiar and foreign: the man's unrefined dress and manners, alongside his entirley typical and humble meal, make him a familar thought perhaps unruly part of late sixteenth-cetury Italian society. The beans, which were at least since the time of Pliny the Elder associated with excessive gas also sugges the food and the person eating it might be disruptive to the social fabric they inhabit. Despite the changing perceptions of the cowpea from familair to foreign, the pea also grew in some gardens throughout Northern Europe. A 1683 record of Edinburgh’s <span eid="Q7189541"> Physical Garden </span>, for example, contains a Phaseolus described as a “small white Kidney-bean with a black spot in the middle.”* 

In Clusius’s remarks on kidney beans, he notes that he saw a drawing of the plant in the <span eid="Q699363"> 'Juliana Anicia Codex' </span> — the oldest surviving copy of Dioscorides’ herbal. He notes that the Spanish have knowledge of the plant. <span eid="Q7322"> Christopher Columbus </span> observed kidney beans in the Americas — a white variety with a black center - which was easily confused with the black-eyed pea. Such ideas circulated throughout the seventeenth century.

For example, in a 1636 edition of English botanist <span eid="Q1333338"> John Gerard’s _Herball_ </span>, or _Generall historie of plants_, the author references Phaseolus peregrinus IIII, describing it as the “Indian Kidney bean with small white fruit.”*

In fact, the cowpea was one of thousands of organisms that crossed from Eurasia to the Americas or vice versa, a process referred to since the 1970s as the <span eid="Q767253"> ‘Columbian Exchange’</span>. The African cowpea is thought to have arrived in the Americas around 1500, though this has been the subject of much debate.* What is accepted, however, is that the cowpea came to the Americas as a result of the trade of enslaved Africans. Black-eyed peas were one of the primary foodstuffs during the trans-Atlantic passage, these beans mixed with fatty oils and rancid meats and fed to captives. Englishman <span eid="Q310326"> Sir Hans Sloane </span> notes the pea in Jamaica around 1687 and created this plant herbarium specimen there. The cowpea was in Virginia by at least 1666, and Florida by around 1700.

The hard labor of enslaved peoples ensured that the black-eyed pea or cowpea was grown and cultivated as a crop largely for livestock throughout the United States, most especially in the South. Black-eyed peas were also a fixture in gardens of enslaved peoples, these beans a hearty supplement to the meagre meals allotted on plantations. The cowpea became “the third most important food crop produced on Carolina plantations between 1730 and 1776.”* <span eid="Q11812"> Thomas Jefferson </span> and <span eid="Q23"> George Washington </span> both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, and Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about growth and cultivation of the plant. By the nineteenth century black-eyed peas achieved new cultural cache and graced the tables of the white ruling class. Enslaved cooks played an important role in bringing this food into rarefied homes.
<param ve-iframe src="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-05-02-0442">
 
Throughout the <span eid="Q8676"> Civil War </span>, cowpeas remained an important food for all people throughout the U.S. In the late nineteenth century, American <span eid="Q2787508"> subsistence farmers </span> were encouraged to grow cowpea even if their local climate meant they didn’t get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the US farming landscape. A 'Farmers Bulletin' of 1920 gave specific official advice on [growing cowpeas](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiOMV1jWGiQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true) in the US. Cowpea was, and still is, mainly grown in southern hotter states and California, as the warm, dry conditions are more favourable for bean production there.

Globally, cowpeas are grown commerically in at least 33 countries, this widespread embrace of the bean uniting geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures. As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out, “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories. Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is fundamental to any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.

## Cross-Cultural Celebrations
In the American South, the vibrant legacies of African culinary traditions preserved by enslaved peoples and their descendants define the region’s cuisine and have inspired countless delicious variations of black-eyed pea-based dishes. That recipe books such as the _Southern Heritage Vegetables Cookbook_ have entire sections dedicated solely to pea recipes, in this case - eight of them black-eyed, speaks to their primacy. They are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory beans and rice dishes.

Black-eyed peas are perhaps most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s. <span eid="Q1763911"> Hoppin’ John </span> is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity for the New Year. It is often served with greens to symbolize wealth and is an absolute must for any southern New Year’s celebration. Brazil’s national dish, <span eid="Q878189"> feijoada completa </span>, has a similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed feijoada “out of scarcity and poverty” made with the black-eyed peas used to feed plantation livestock boiled with discarded pork. Today, however, it is a special and celebratory meal for every level of society, “which requires multiple days to prepare and, served with rice and greens, constitutes an entire meal.” In both cases of the Hoppin’ John and feijoada completa, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, a transformation so tied to Twitty’s concept of identity cooking that it deserves a narrative of its own.

## A Colonial Crop
Although black-eyed pea was not grown as a crop in Britain (it being far too cold and wet), its inclusion in the [Economic Botany Collection](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/collections/economic-botany-collection) of the <span eid="Q18748726"> Royal Botanic Gardens Kew </span> is telling.  Here, over a hundred different collections of [seeds](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/main_image.php?imageid=EBC_68901), pods, ‘fibre’ and even a [model](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/read_ecbot.php?catno=61536&search_term=vigna%20unguiculata&search_type=name&imagechecklist=Images) of cowpea are kept, mean that it was obviously studied as a useful colonial crop plant. Donations are as diverse as from Nigeria, India, Laos, China and Japan, but also from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed such as the <span eid="Q5148408"> Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 </span>, the Japan/British Exhibition of 1910, the British Industries Fair of 1930, as well as the <span eid="Q10534945"> India Museum </span>, the Imperial Institute, the Jamaica Agricultural Society, and colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567"> Dr WB Baikie's </span> Niger Expedition of 1859. One undated individual collection was even donated by the HRH the Prince of Wales, from the ‘East Indies’.

## Modern production
Today, worldwide production of black-eyed peas or cowpeas is hard to estimate as cultivation is still mainly in the hands of small-holder farmers, but also because they are such a staple food that most harvests are used locally rather than being exported. The centres of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s cowpea crop. It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in many different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains. It is the third most important pulse worldwide, feeding hundreds of millions of people.

## A food of the future 
The black-eyed pea or cowpea is an often-overlooked crop, but soon we may all be more familiar with it. Legumes are emerging as ‘foods of the future’ due to their very nature of being highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow. They will play an important part in future food security – providing food in a changing climate and will continue to help small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger and improve their livelihoods. As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, and as more people aim to eat less meat, legume crops such as cowpeas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.

## Crop wild relatives
However, even though the cowpea is considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic. Crop breeding can try to alleviate future potential issues and make the cowpea even more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015"> relatives </span> of the cowpea may hold genes or genetic traits that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions. If these traits can be bred into agricultural varieties then the future may look even brighter for the cowpea. The global Crop Wild Relatives Project (CWRP) has been aiming to do just that in partnership with 33 countries and [seed banks](https://vimeo.com/67899663), including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA)and <span eid="Q2603353"> Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank </span>. There are eleven primary wild relatives of the cowpea being researched. Their importance demonstrates how vital it is to protect wild plants and wild habitats for the future. In a telling [quote](https://www.cwrdiversity.org/cowpea/) from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be an unfailing friend even while the climate crisis is affecting production.”
