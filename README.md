# Black-eyed Peas

Black-eyed peas or cowpeas (_Vigna unguiculata_ L. Walp) are both an ancient crop and a food of the future. Also known as crowder pea, caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies and akkerboon in South Africa; its many names reflect its worldwide appeal. These nourishing, easily-grown <span eid="Q145909"> legumes </span> are closely related to mung beans, adzuki beans and bambara groundnuts.

## A pea by many names

The recording of these many monikers reveals much about the pea’s widespread use as well as the history of botanical study and its formation within various colonial empires. In European botany there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification. <span eid="Q1043"> Linnaeus (L.) </span>  gave this plant the scientific name _Dolichos unguiculatus_ in his <span eid=Q849308"> _Species Plantarum_ </span> of 1753 from a specimen from Barbados, but this African plant was formally renamed in 1974 as _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp._unguiculata_. However, it was well known as the cowpea throughout ancient Europe and Asia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike.

## An easy, useful crop

Cowpeas grow best in semi-arid conditions, poor soils and with little help. They are heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. Grown since ancient times, these (mainly annual) leguminous plants (in the plant family Fabaceae) have now become a staple part of the diets of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is not just the seeds (the beans or peas as we call them) that are harvested however – the leaves and pods of this reliable plant are also edible and used as a vegetable, or can be used for cattle fodder or hay, and, being legumes, they also enrich the soil through the presence of around 21 different (bradyrhizobial) symbiotic <span eid="Q15098397"> nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules </span> on their roots.

## Food in the Deep Past

Genomic sequencing suggests that humans domesticated an earlier wild relative independently in two regions: in West Africa, with vegetation zones [1] that change based on latitude, and East Africa, with vegetation zones that change based on altitude. Even to the present day, ecotones are valuable sites for settlement because they allow for mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing and aquaculture, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, agroforestry, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.  Because cowpeas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are useful crops the whole year round! 

Plant biologists look at the genetic structure of different specimens to determine how closely related they are. Specialists in historical linguistics have applied a similar technique to language families. Today, over 500 Bantu languages are spoken by hundreds of millions of people across Southern Africa as the result of a process historians call the Bantu Expansions. Comparing today’s languages with each other lets scientists reconstruct the languages of the past. Watch as the root for ‘cowpea,’ kunde, appears in languages across the continent.

By 1500 BCE this faithful friend had spread through North Africa and beyond: out to the Mediterranean, the Arabian peninsula, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Ancient Greek physician Dioscorides’ herbal De Materia Medica dubs the cowpea phasiolos. This name referred to any sort of bean or pea (these terms used interchangeably in Dioscoride’s time).

QUESTION: 
There’s a big jump from the very, very distant past to the advent of printed books. I’m going to try to bridge that gap with a few little snippets that connect to Central Asia, Indian Subcontinent, Arabian peninsula, reaching out to colleagues who specialize there. I don’t know what I’ll find yet (art, recipes, archaeology, who knows?) but please let me know what you think about this idea?

## 16th-18th
As we’ve seen, cowpeas had been consumed for millennia, especially in the Mediterranean, but many Northern European botanists were writing based on others’ descriptions or on specimens entering their collection in unfamiliar conditions. Botanist Carolus Clusius’s influential 1601 Rariorum Plantarum Historia (History of Rare Plants) refers to cowpea as Phaseolus peregrinus. Peregrinus comes from the Latin peregre ‘abroad’—literally per- ‘through’ + ager ‘field’—and Clusius communicates to his reader that the pea comes from a foreign, distant place. In Clusius’s remarks on kidney beans, he notes that he saw a drawing of the plant in the Juliana Anicia Codex—the oldest surviving copy of Dioscorides’ herbal. He notes that the Spanish have knowledge of the plant. Christopher Columbus observed kidney beans in the Americas—a white variety with a black center—perhaps introduced confusion on the bean’s origin. (f/u on this section, what’s the claim, source, etc?).
For example, in a 1636 edition of English botanist John Gerard’s Herball, or Generall historie of plants, the author references Phaseolus peregrinus IIII, describing it as the “Indian Kidney bean with small white fruit.” (Indian Kidney Bean from Herball, or Generall historieof plants, p  1213)

(Vigna unguiculata from Dioscorides manuscript Codex Vindobonensis Med. Gr. I, or Codex Aniciae Julianae, folio 370v. Pigment on parchment, c. 512 A.D. Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna. Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna.

In fact, the cowpea was one of thousands of organisms that crossed from Eurasia to the Americas or vice versa, a process referred to since the 1970s as the ‘Columbian Exchange’. Black-eyed peas were one of the primary foodstuffs during the transatlantic passage, these beans mixed with fatty oils and rancid meats and fed to captives. Englishman Sir Hans Sloane notes the pea in Jamaica around 1687. It was in Virginia by at least 1666, and Florida by around 1700.

The hard labor of enslaved peoples ensured that the black-eyed pea was grown and cultivated as a crop largely for livestock throughout the United States, most especially in the South. Black-eyed peas were also a fixture in gardens of enslaved peoples, these beans a hearty supplement to the meagre meals allotted on plantations. The cowpea became “the third most important food crop produced on Carolina plantations between 1730 and 1776.” Thomas Jefferson and George Washington both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, and Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about growth and cultivation of the plant. By the nineteenth century black-eyed peas achieved new cultural cache and graced the tables of the white ruling class. Enslaved cooks played an important role in bringing this food into rarefied homes.

(Images of letters from Washington, Jefferson)
 
Throughout the Civil War, cowpeas remained an important food for all people throughout the U.S. In the late nineteenth century, American subsistence farmers (Q2787508) were encouraged to grow cowpea even if their local climate meant they didn’t get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the US farming landscape. Cowpea was, and still is, mainly grown in southern hotter states and California, as the warm, dry conditions are more favourable for bean production there.

A Farmers Bulletin of 1920 gives official advice on growing cowpeas in the US. Morse, W. J. (William Joseph). (1920). Cowpeas: utilization. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. From Hathi Trust:

Globally, black-eyed peas grow in at least 33 <I think its more like 100? Let’s check> countries, this widespread embrace of the bean uniting geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures. As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out, “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories. Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is fundamental to any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.

## Cross-Cultural Celebrations
In the American South, the vibrant legacies of African culinary traditions preserved by enslaved peoples and their descendants define the region’s cuisine and have inspired countless delicious variations of black-eyed pea-based dishes. That recipe books such as the Southern Heritage Vegetables Cookbook has an entire section dedicated solely to pea recipes, eight of them black-eyed, speaks to their primacy. They are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory beans and rice dishes.

Black-eyed peas are perhaps most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s. Hoppin’ John is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity for the New Year. It is often served with greens to symbolize wealth and is an absolute must for any southern New Year’s celebration. Brazil’s national dish, feijoada completa, has a similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed feijoada “out of scarcity and poverty” made with the black-eyed peas used to feed plantation livestock boiled with discarded pork. Today, however, it is a special and celebratory meal for every level of society, “which requires multiple days to prepare and, served with rice and greens, constitutes an entire meal.” In both cases of the Hoppin’ John and feijoada completa, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, a transformation so tied to Twitty’s concept of identity cooking that it deserves a narrative of its own.

## A Colonial Crop
Although black-eyed pea was not grown as a crop in Britain (it being far too cold and wet), its inclusion in the Economic Botany Collection of the <span eid="Q18748726"> Royal Botanic Gardens Kew </span> is telling.  Here, over a hundred different collections of seeds, pods, ‘fibre’ and even models of cowpea are kept, mean that it was obviously studied as a useful colonial crop plant. Donations are as diverse as from Nigeria, India, Laos, China and Japan, but also from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed such as the <span eid="Q5148408"> Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 </span>, the Japan/British Exhibition of 1910, the British Industries Fair of 1930, as well as the <span eid="Q10534945"> India Museum </span>, the Imperial Institute, the Jamaica Agricultural Society, and colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567"> Dr WB Baikie's </span> Niger Expedition of 1859. One undated individual collection was even donated by the HRH the Prince of Wales, from the ‘East Indies’. 

Cowpeas were displayed at colonial exhibitions including the Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 in London; this image shows the stand for produce of Jamaica. <param ve-image

## Modern production
Today, worldwide production of black-eyed peas or cowpeas is hard to estimate as cultivation is still mainly in the hands of small-holder farmers, but also because they are such a staple food that most harvests are used locally rather than being exported. The centres of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s cowpea crop. It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in around 100 <check> different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains. It is the third most important pulse worldwide, feeding hundreds of millions of people.

## A food of the future
The black-eyed pea or cowpea is an often-overlooked crop, but soon we may all be more familiar with it. Legumes are emerging as ‘foods of the future’ due to their very nature of being highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow. They will play an important part in future food security – providing food in a changing climate and will continue to help small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger and improve their livelihoods. As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, and as more people aim to eat less meat, legume crops such as cowpeas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.

However, even though the cowpea is considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic. Crop breeding can try to alleviate future potential issues and make the cowpea even more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015"> relatives </span> of the cowpea may hold genes that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions. If these genes can be bred into agricultural varieties then the future may look even brighter for the cowpea. The global Crop Wild Relatives Project (CWRP) has been aiming to do just that in partnership with 33 countries and seed banks such as <span eid="Q2603353"> Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank </span> in the UK. In a telling quote from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be an unfailing friend even while the climate crisis is affecting production.”

# Proposal for Interactive Elements:
                        
## Interactive digital game: 
                        
We will make an interactive image of a pea plant that presents a description of each plant part when you mouse over them. This can be made by isolating the various parts of a pea plant image through Photoshop and making an interactive “game” in Unity. When the user mouses over the leaves, flower, or pod, a pop-up will appear with a description of the part and its uses. Ron has confirmed that this can be easily embedded in a Juncture essay.
                        
## Map w/ linguistics
                        
We will make a Geo JSON map showing where the word for black-eyed pea/cowpea entered Bantu languages in Africa over time. This way, we can show the spread of the plant itself throughout Africa over time.
                        
## Map w/ plant distribution over time

In addition to the more specific map suggested above, we will have a more general map showing where black-eyed peas are grown throughout the world and the estimated year cultivation began in that region. 
                        
## Embed video of Michael Twitty’s recipe
                        
Michael Twitty has several YouTube videos where he cooks authentic historical recipes of the antebellum American South and discusses their history and significance.. We would like to add one of them to our section on the black-eyed pea’s culinary history.
