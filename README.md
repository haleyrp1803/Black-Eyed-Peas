## Black-eyed Peas

Black-eyed peas or cowpeas (_Vigna unguiculata_ L. Walp) are both an ancient crop and a food of the future. Also known as crowder pea, caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies and akkerboon in South Africa;[^ref1] its many names reflect its worldwide appeal. These nourishing, protein-rich, easily-grown <span eid="Q145909"> legumes </span> are closely related to mung beans, adzuki beans and bambara groundnuts.

## An easy, useful crop
Black-eyed peas grow best in semi-arid conditions, poor soils and with little help. They are heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. Grown since ancient times, these (mainly annual) leguminous plants (in the plant family Fabaceae) have now become a staple part of the diets of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is not just the seeds (the beans or peas as we call them) that are harvested however – the leaves and pods of this reliable plant are also edible and used as a vegetable, or can be used for cattle fodder or hay,[^ref2] and, being legumes, they also enrich the soil through the presence of around 21 different (bradyrhizobial) symbiotic <span eid="Q15098397"> nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules </span> on their roots.[^ref3]

## Food in the Deep Past

Genomic sequencing suggests that humans domesticated an earlier wild relative independently in two regions: in West Africa, with vegetation zones [1] that change based on latitude, and East Africa, with vegetation zones that change based on altitude. Even to the present day, <span eid="Q55613"> ecotones </span> are valuable sites for settlement because they allow for mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing and aquaculture, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, <span eid="Q397350"> agroforestry </span>, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.  Because black-eyed peas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are useful crops the whole year round!

By 1500 BCE, the black-eyed pea or cowpea had spread through North Africa and beyond: out to the Mediterranean, the Arabian peninsula, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.  The native range of the cowpea in Africa (here shown in blue) and its subsequent introduction across the world (in green) can be seen on this map.

## Early Modern European History
As we’ve seen, black-eyed peas had been consumed for millennia, especially in the Mediterranean. Records of their consumption and use within Europe during the Middle Ages (roughly the fifth through to the fifteenth centuries), however, are relatively scarce. Humble beans, understood as a food for peasants and livestock, would have been considered subject matter too lowly for inclusion in the annals of history. Indeed, surviving historical documents, for example letters or works of art from this period, very often focus on the interests of wealthier individuals who would have thought themselves too refined to consume black-eyed peas. Since antiquity, the black-eyed pea has been a cultural marker of those who lacked social status. Ancient Roman chronicler <span eid="Q82778"> Pliny </span> wrote that priests should avoid eating the food for fear its rough nature would upset their delicate and finely attuned constitutions. He also notes that <span eid="Q10261"> Pythagoras </span> and his followers did not eat black-eyed peas because they “believed the souls of the dead to be contained within" the dried beans.[^ref10] 
<param ve-image

       url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Plinius_t_y_Venezia_1499_IMG_3886.JPG">

Moreover, the stigma of eating dried foods, rather than fresh, further impinged the reputation of the bean and its eaters: while wealthy and socially powerful individuals could afford fresh foods, peasants relied upon cheaper dried foods. This imbrication of class, culture, and food is apparent, for example, in ancient Greek and Roman 'unswept floor' mosaics, which are meant to depict the scraps strewn across a floor after a lavish banquet. Pliny himself commented on such artworks. In perhaps the most famous example of this genre (completed by the ancient Greek artist <span eid="Q116658"> Sosus of Pergamon </span> in the 2nd century BCE), lobster shells, olive pits, partially eaten fish, and nuts litter the ground, but nary a bean is to be found. 
<param ve-iframe

The oft-repeated adage 'you are what you eat,' was the rule of the day; those who ate fresh foods were understood as the wiser and healther social elite, while the consumers of dried foods were understood as less intelligent, somewhat unhealthy agents of a rough and tumble lifestyle. Such ideas persisted into the early modern period and can be seen, for example, in Italian artist <span eid="Q7824"> Annibale Carracci's </span> painting _The Bean Eater_ (painted c. 1590), which depicts a man eating a bowl of black-eyed peas. Carracci's painterly style in this work, a collection of swiftly rendered and unblended brushstrokes that give the appearance of a rough surface, acknowledges the man's status: unrefined in dress and manners, he eats a humble meal of black-eyed peas. This depiction relies on a familiar trope of peasant life and suggests the man and his food are perhaps unruly parts of late sixteenth-century Italy's deeply heirarchical and classist society. The beans, associated with excessive gas, also suggest the food and the person eating it might be disruptive to the social fabric they inhabit. Despite the fact that black-eyed peas had been a vital part of the Southern European diet and culture for centuries, they are here presented as both marginal and familiar, this form of othering a glimpse of what was to come for the black-eyed pea.

Carracci was not the only artist to depict beans or peas. Throughout Europe, there are various artworks that took inspiration from peas (be it their leaves, their delicate blossoms, or their sinuous tendril-filled vines). The peas depicted, however, were not of the black-eyed variety, but rather verdant green peas considered domestic to Europe, such as the English green pea. The plant became an emblem for love, fertility, and even lust. The fresh green pea was also a food for the elite, and they decorated their homes and gardens accordingly. In painter <span eid="Q7751"> Giuseppe Arcimboldo's </span> allegorical portrait of _The Summer_ (from 1573) he captures a moment in the cycle of seasons when plants are at their most fertile. He uses a green peapod to represent a woman's smiling mouth. Each tooth is corresponds to a perfectly round pea, her spreading smile a literal show of abundance. Compared to Carraci's rough brushtrokes, Arcimboldo's work uses fine brushwork to create the painting's smooth surface. Arcimboldo's paintings were made for wealthy European aristocrats who would have delighted in the variety of plants (many of which they ate) contained within each painting, these works a veritable botanical garden rendered in human form. Few people beyond the patron of the painting would have seen Archimbolo's work. Likewise, this same eschelon of elite patronage often funded and maintained verdant, often private, gardens. Just as the artist's paintings remaind hidden away, so too do their inspiration. One of Arcimboldo's patrons, <span eid="Q150586"> Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II <span>, oversaw from his seat of power in Vienna some of the finest botanical gardens in all of Europe.

Seventeenth-century virtuoso wood carver <span eid="Q610462"> Grinling Gibbons </span> produced beautifully elaborate carved wood panelling for British aristocracy, including for King William and Queen Mary at Hampton Court Palace. The artist famously nestled a carved peapod in many of his works, this his signature motif. Dutch painters of this period also produced lush still life paintings which featured all manner of flora and fauna. These paintings in part were meant to remind the viewer of life's fleeting abundance. In <span eid="Q454656"> Jan Davidsz. de Heem's </span> painting _Vase of Flowers_, c. 1660, we see a sumptuous array of flowers with several peapods at the base of the vase. Four of the verdant green pods are closed but appear plump and full peas just ready for the eating, while another sallow pod has opened up and is being eaten by glossy black ants. The artist reveals how quickly the abundance and luxury of a fresh green pea soon spoils. The painter's commentary might also be related to the pea's power to symbolize what was then understood as a form of moral ruin: peapods were synonymous with male genitalia and the term "shelling peas" became a euphamism for illicit sexual intercourse.[^ref11] Thus, the open (or shelled peapod) appears past its prime while its unshelled counterparts remain vibrantly green.

Images of black-eyed peas and other varieties of beans and peas shaped European understandings of the plant. The dramatic rise in the production and circulation of printed texts with images, beginning in the sixteenth century, alongside unprecedented global travel formed European ideas about the local and the foreign, and the ways in which close observation of the natural world could reveal the origins of a person, plant, or an animal. One result of this study was a shift in European attitudes toward the black-eyed pea. Despite the millennia-old European presence of the black-eyed pea, it was now understood there as an itinerant body within a Euro-centric taxonomy of plants. Informing such ideas were widely circulated printed books, often containing illustrations, written by European travellers visiting Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Their observations were soon understood throughout Europe as factual accounts, though the information contained in these volumes was not always accurate. For example, Dutchman <span eid="Q3117063"> Pieter de Marees’ </span> 1602 book describing West Africa shows the black-eyed pea in a landscape which, while meant to represent Africa, is actually an imaginary setting. We see people alongside plants that while native to Africa would not have grown in such close proximity.[^ref12] The viewer is meant to elide the black-eyed pea with Africa's geography and peoples, this distinction revealing Europe's increasingly myopic gaze upon the rest of the world. Other printed texts such as herbals or natural histories also reinforced the codification of plants based on their geographic origins.

## What's in a Name?
Although they were not a high status item by the time Carracci's peasant sat down for his meal, authors since ancient times have described black-eyed peas in texts on plants and the natural world. In European botany there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification.[^ref17] These changes in nomeclature also reveal emerging Euroean ideas about the local and the foreign. More recently, taxonomists have been re-classifying the genus _Vigna_ and today all cultivated black-eyed peas are grouped under _Vigna unguiculata_ subspecies _unguiculata_. However, it was well known by many common names throughout ancient Eurasia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike.

## World Traveller 
In fact, the black-eyed pea was one of thousands of organisms that crossed from Eurasia to the Americas or vice versa, a process referred to since the 1970s as the <span eid="Q767253"> ‘Columbian Exchange’</span>. The African cowpea is thought to have arrived in the Americas around 1500, though this has been the subject of much debate.[^ref13] What is accepted, however, is that the black-eyed pea came to the Americas as a result of the trade of enslaved Africans and New World plantations. In Africa, black-eyed peas were an important staple crop as well as an omen of auspicious occasions, a sign of fertility, an offering to various dieties, a force of connection between ancestors and greater spiritual forces in the world. The cowpea was an important part of many complex and bundant cultural practices as well, helping inspire and fuel the creation of artistic expressions and rituals. Black-eyed peas, however, also came to represent the supporession of culture as one of the primary foodstuffs used during the trans-Atlantic passage, these beans mixed with fatty oils and rancid meats and fed to captives. Englishman <span eid="Q310326"> Sir Hans Sloane </span> notes the pea in Jamaica around 1687 and created this plant specimen there as part of his large Jamaican herbarium. The black-eyed pea was in Virginia by at least the mid-seventeenth century, and Florida by around 1700.

The hard labor of enslaved peoples ensured that the black-eyed pea or cowpea was grown and cultivated as a crop largely for livestock throughout the United States, most especially in the South. Black-eyed peas were both a food served to enslaved peoples as well as a fixture in gardens of enslaved peoples, these beans a hearty supplement to the meagre meals allotted on plantations. Numerous first-hand accounts of enslaved peoples mention black-eyed peas. In Charles Ball's memoire he recalls, "We had plenty of bread, and a supply of black-eyed peas, gathered from our garden, some of which [were] boiled in our kettle, whilst I was gone for the soup; of which there was as much as we could consume, and I believe that every one in the quarter had enough." [^ref18]. Francis Fedric, also enslaved, wrote of the bean, "Slaves every Monday morning have a certain quantity of Indian corn handed out to them; this they grind with a handmill, and boil or use the meal as they like. The adult slaves have one salt herring allowed for breakfast, during the winter time. The breakfast hour is usually from ten to eleven o'clock. The dinner consists generally of black-eyed peas soup, as it is called. About a quart of peas is boiled in a large pan, and a small piece of meat, just to flavour the soup, is put into the pan. The next day it would be bean soup ...the soup being served out to the men and women in bowls; but the children feed like pigs out of troughs." [^ref19] Black-eyed peas became “the third most important food crop produced on Carolina plantations between 1730 and 1776.”[^ref16] <span eid="Q11812"> Thomas Jefferson </span> and <span eid="Q23"> George Washington </span> both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, and Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about growth and cultivation of the plant, which in a [letter of 1787](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-05-02-0442) he calls "small, and round black eyed Pease called the Gentlemans Pea". Jefferson considered the cultivation of peas a pursuit worthy of a gentleman, harkening back to European traditions which placed greater social and cultiral status on green peas. He held yearly pea growing contests, with the first man to produce a fresh pea was required to host a dinner for other genetlemen in the area. By the nineteenth century, black-eyed peas, however, achieved new cultural cache and graced the tables of the white ruling class. Enslaved cooks played an important role in bringing this food into rarefied homes.

Throughout the <span eid="Q8676"> Civil War </span>, black-eyed peas remained an important food throughout the southern U.S., while in the North they were associated with the practice of slavery and therefore deemed undesirable. At times, the pea might have also seemed undesirable to residents of the South. In Adelaide Stuart Dimitry's memoirs of the war years (1861 - 1865), she notes that food was often hard to come by, though the black-eyed pea remained a reliable--to the point of tiresome--source of food. She recalls, "Once at home came the dinner - where it came from was the daily surprise of life. Sometimes it consisted only of a large platter of newly-dug goobers or peanuts, boiled in salt water, but always sauced with a wondrous appetite - in that dour time never lacking in Richmond. Thrice-blessed was the household so lucky as to have a country friend. An angel of relief she came in with a basket of vegetables - generally mustard greens - in one hand, covered maybe with apple blossoms to take off its sordidness, and bending under the weight of a big jug of buttermilk. What luxury and feasting for the next few days! What visions of savory dumplings with the greens, to say nothing of a left-over for salad! But oh, the eternal, dried, black-eyed pea whether in porridge or soup, baked or boiled, ever the same villainous comestible that made one weary of going to the table!"[^ref20] In the late nineteenth century, American <span eid="Q2787508"> subsistence farmers </span> were encouraged to grow the black-eyed pea or cowpea even if their local climate meant they didn’t get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the U.S farming landscape. Noted American scientist and innovative proponet of crop rotations, <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span> – who was enslaved at birth in Missouri in 1864 and freed after the Civil War – urged farmers in the American South to plant black-eyed peas to help replenish soil depleted by cotton farming while also cultivating an easily grown grop that could help lift formerly enslaved peoples out of systemically reinforced poverty. He wrote of the plant, "The cow pea is rightfully looked upon by many as the poor man’s bank or mortgage-lifter ... It is a matter of much regret that every colored farmer in Macon County does not plant at least three acres in peas."[^ref15]

A 'Farmers Bulletin' of 1920 gave specific official advice on [growing cowpeas](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiOMV1jWGiQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true) in the U.S. Black-eyed peas were, and still are, mainly grown in southern hotter states and California, as the warm, dry conditions are more favourable for bean production there.

## Black-eyed peas in Asia
How black-eyed peas travelled from Africa into Asia is the subject of conjecture as archeological evidencce is hard to come by. Many think it was simply taken along trade routes via Egypt and the Yemen and reached India by 1200 BCE. Written records of the pea appear in the 16th century in China where it is noted in the Ming Dynasty Compendium Materia Medica as (ironically) being a cure for flatulence, as well as kidney problems. In India, black-eyed peas were noted by Thomas Herbert in 1634 as "Indian pease" by which he was referencing the peas he had seen in the West Indies.[^ref68] Meanwhile, in Japan, a copy of the extraordinary 30-volume agricultural encyclopaedia _Seikei Zuetsu_ (written 1793-1804) was gifted to the German physician, botanist and plant collector <span eid="Q77140">Philipp von Siebold</span> in the 1820s. Siebold arrived in Nagasaki in 1823 and started a medical school there, but spent much of his spare time studying Japanese flora and creating his own botanical garden of Japanese plants.[^ref69] The _Seikei Zuetsu_ detailed 109 crops of southern Japan and inside its beautifully illustrated pages can be found the 'cowpea' – most probably showing _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp. _unguiculata_ cv.-gr. _sesquipedalis_ or the 'yard-long bean' which was and still is popular in Asia today.[^ref70] Its presence in this Japanese book of crops from 1800 shows how far the black-eyed pea had come and how its usefulness had been welcomed into many agricultural traditions.

Today, black-eyed peas are grown commercially in at least 33 countries,[^ref71] this widespread embrace of the bean uniting geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures. As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out, “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories.[^ref72] Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is useful to keep in mind for any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.[^ref73]

Black-eyed peas are a staple of the <span eid="Q49042"> Southern American </span> diet and an iconic component of Black culinary history. The peas are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory bean and rice dishes, but perhaps they are most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s. <span eid="Q1763911"> Hoppin’ John </span> is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity. It is often served with greens to symbolize wealth and is an absolute must for any modern Southern New Year’s celebration. [^ref74][^ref75] <span eid="Q1810575"> Thiebou niebe,</span> a classic Senegalese dish made similarly from black-eyed peas, rice, and ham, may be the base where the recipe originated.

Hoppin’ John’s symbolism is one of prosperity, but its origin is anything but. On brutal American plantations, enslaved workers created new meals from West African recipes and the crops they had access to in the New World. They grew black-eyed peas and other African crops in their subsistence gardens outside the long hours they were forced to labor in their enslaver’s fields. The white ruling class saw black-eyed peas as a lowly food meant to feed livestock and the enslaved. To them, the peas seemed to fit in alongside the pork scraps used to cook Hoppin’ John. [^ref78]

In addition to field labor, enslaved women were often made to cook for the planter’s family as well as their own. This is how African foodstuffs like the black-eyed pea, mustard, collard greens, etc. were introduced to, and eventually taken up by, the Southern diet at large. By the 19th century, white women began including Black recipes in their homemaker cookbooks, of course, without crediting the women who pioneered them. [^ref79][^ref80][^ref81]

Brazil’s national dish, <span eid="Q878189"> _feijoada completa_, </span> has a very similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed _feijoada_ out of very little. It was originally a simple but filling dish made with the black-eyed peas or black beans and discarded pork. Today, however, it is a complex and celebratory meal for every level of society, taking days to prepare and involving many more ingredients and side dishes. It is especially associated with Carnival and religious ceremonies, but simple beans and rice dishes are a national staple.[^ref82][^ref83]

For both Hoppin’ John and _feijoada completa_, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, as well as a symbol of unity across racial lines. However, that’s an overly simplistic view of a complex issue. Southern cooking especially can only be viewed as culturally unifying at the surface level. In reality, there is still much tension in questions of representation, ownership, class, race, and identity in Southern food and <span eid="Q555997"> Soul food,</span> with white perspectives usually being unjustly prioritized over Black ones.

## A Colonial Crop
Although black-eyed pea was not grown as a crop in Britain (it usually being far too cold and wet), its inclusion in the [Economic Botany Collection](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/collections/economic-botany-collection) of the <span eid="Q18748726"> Royal Botanic Gardens Kew </span> is telling.  Here, over a hundred different collections of [seeds](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/main_image.php?imageid=EBC_68901), pods, ‘fibre’ and even a [model](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/read_ecbot.php?catno=61536&search_term=vigna%20unguiculata&search_type=name&imagechecklist=Images) of black-eyed peas are kept, mean that it was obviously studied as a useful colonial crop plant. Donations are as diverse as from Nigeria, India, Laos, China and Japan, but also from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed such as the <span eid="Q5148408"> Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 </span>, the Japan/British Exhibition of 1910, the British Industries Fair of 1930, as well as the <span eid="Q10534945"> India Museum </span>, the Imperial Institute, the Jamaica Agricultural Society, and colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567"> Dr WB Baikie's </span> Niger Expedition of 1859. One undated individual collection was even donated by the HRH the Prince of Wales, from the ‘East Indies’.

## Modern production
Today, worldwide production of black-eyed peas or cowpeas is hard to estimate as cultivation is still mainly in the hands of small-holder farmers, but also because they are such a staple food that most harvests are used locally rather than being exported. However the FAO estimate around 7 million tonnes are produced annually. [^ref86] The centres of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s black-eyed pea crop. [^ref87] It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in many different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains such as sorghum and millet or rice.[^ref88] It is the third most important pulse worldwide, an important element of sustainable agriculture, and feeds hundreds of millions of people.

## A food of the future 
The black-eyed pea is an often-overlooked 'minor' crop, but soon we may all be more familiar with it. Legumes are emerging as ‘foods of the future’ due to their very nature of being highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow. They will play an important part in future food security – providing food in a changing climate and will continue to help small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger and improve their livelihoods.[^ref89] As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, and as more people aim to eat less meat, legume crops such as black-eyed peas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.[^ref90][^ref91]

One can view the growing diet culture and veganism of the West alongide this increased environmental awareness. In both contexts, black-eyed peas and other legumes are growing in status as a key cooking ingredient. There are hundreds of such recipes readily available online and in cookbooks. Some health-focused cookbooks are regional, aiming to transform, for example, traditional southern recipes like black-eyed peas with pork to leaner, lower-sodium alternatives. [^ref92] Others combine recipes across many cultures, like _The Great Vegan Bean Book_, which aims to give vegans more options for flavorful meatless protein. These types of cookbooks often marry recipes inspired by the American South with Indian, African, and Caribbean cuisines. [^ref93] [^ref94]

Vegetables, like spinach, carrots, and broccoli. Whole grain cereal, whole grain bread, and whole grain pasta."

## Crop wild relatives
Even though black-eyed peas are considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic with climate change. Crop breeding can try to alleviate future potential issues and make black-eyed peas even more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015"> relatives </span> of the black-eyed pea may hold genes or genetic traits that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions, and perhaps be more pest-resistant.[^ref95] If these traits can be bred into commercial varieties then the black-eyed pea may be one of the answers to the many agricultural challenges of the future. Over recent decades significant resources have been put into researching black-eyed peas and their potential. The Crop Wild Relatives Project is one such project in partnership with 33 countries [^ref96] and global seed banks including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and <span eid="Q2603353"> Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank </span>. There are currently eleven primary wild relatives of the black-eyed pea are being researched. Southern and western Africa are hotspots for wild black-eyed pea genetic variation. The importance of such relatives demonstrates how vital it is to protect wild plants and wild habitats for the future. In a telling [quote](https://www.cwrdiversity.org/cowpea/) from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be _an unfailing friend_ even while the climate crisis is affecting production.”
