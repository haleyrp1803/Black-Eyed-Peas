## Black-eyed Peas

Black-eyed peas or cowpeas (_Vigna unguiculata_ L. Walp) are both an ancient crop and a food of the future. Also known as crowder pea, caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies and akkerboon in South Africa;[^ref1] its many names reflect its worldwide appeal. These nourishing, protein-rich, easily-grown <span eid="Q145909"> legumes </span> are closely related to mung beans, adzuki beans and bambara groundnuts.

## An easy, useful crop
Cowpeas grow best in semi-arid conditions, poor soils and with little help. They are heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. Grown since ancient times, these (mainly annual) leguminous plants (in the plant family Fabaceae) have now become a staple part of the diets of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is not just the seeds (the beans or peas as we call them) that are harvested however – the leaves and pods of this reliable plant are also edible and used as a vegetable, or can be used for cattle fodder or hay,[^ref2] and, being legumes, they also enrich the soil through the presence of around 21 different (bradyrhizobial) symbiotic <span eid="Q15098397"> nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules </span> on their roots.[^ref3]

## Food in the Deep Past <!--images still to go in-->
Genomic sequencing suggests that humans domesticated an earlier wild relative independently in two regions: in West Africa, with vegetation zones [1] that change based on latitude, and East Africa, with vegetation zones that change based on altitude. Even to the present day, <span eid="Q55613"> ecotones </span> are valuable sites for settlement because they allow for mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing and aquaculture, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, <span eid="Q397350"> agroforestry </span>, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.  Because cowpeas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are useful crops the whole year round!

Plant biologists look at the genetic structure of different specimens to determine how closely related they are. Specialists in <span eid="Q190375"> historical linguistics </span> have applied a similar technique to language families. Today, over 500 Bantu languages are spoken by hundreds of millions of people across Southern Africa as the result of a process historians call the <span eid="Q130251"> Bantu Expansions </span>. Comparing today’s languages with each other lets scientists reconstruct the languages of the past. Watch as the root for ‘cowpea,’ kunde, appears in languages across the continent.

By 1500 BCE the cowpea had spread through North Africa and beyond: out to the Mediterranean, the Arabian peninsula, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.  The native range of the cowpea in Africa and its subsequent introduction across the world can be seen in this map.

## Early Modern History
As we’ve seen, cowpeas had been consumed for millennia, especially in the Mediterranean. Records of their consumption and use within Europe during the middle ages (X- X), however, are relatively scarce. This is likely due to the bean's humble status as a coarse food for peasants and livestock. Indeed, surviving historical documents, for example letters or works of art from this period, very often focus on the interests of wealthier individuals who would have thought themselves too refined to consume black-eyed peas in large quantities. Likewise, individuals consuming such beans would have likely lacked access to the funds or education to document their thoughts on the cowpea. This MORE HERE.  Despite the millennia-old European presence of the cowpea, it was now understood there as an itinerant body. Informing such ideas HOW? was Dutchman Pieter de Marees’ 1602 book describing West Africa, which included an image of the black-eyed pea growing in the landscape.*

Italian artist <span eid="Q7824"> Annibale Carracci's </span> painting _The Bean Eater_ (painted c. 1590), which depicts a peasant eating a bowl of black-eyed peas, also acknowledges the cowpea's status as both familiar and foreign: the man's unrefined dress and manners, alongside his entirely typical and humble meal, make him a familiar though perhaps unruly part of late sixteenth-century Italian society. The beans, which were, at least since the time of Pliny the Elder, associated with excessive gas also suggest the food and the person eating it might be disruptive to the social fabric they inhabit.

Although they were not a high status item by the time Carracci's peasant sat down for his meal, authors since ancient times have described cowpeas in texts on plants and the natural world. In European botany there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification. More recently, taxonomists have been re-classifying the genus _Vigna_ and today all cultivated cowpeas are grouped under _Vigna unguiculata_ subspecies _unguiculata_. However, it was well known by many common names throughout ancient Eurasia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike.

## World Traveller 
In fact, the cowpea was one of thousands of organisms that crossed from Eurasia to the Americas or vice versa, a process referred to since the 1970s as the <span eid="Q767253"> ‘Columbian Exchange’</span>. The African cowpea is thought to have arrived in the Americas around 1500, though this has been the subject of much debate.* What is accepted, however, is that the cowpea came to the Americas as a result of the trade of enslaved Africans. Cowpeas were one of the primary foodstuffs during the trans-Atlantic passage, these beans mixed with fatty oils and rancid meats and fed to captives. Englishman <span eid="Q310326"> Sir Hans Sloane </span> notes the pea in Jamaica around 1687 and created this plant specimen there as part of his large Jamaican herbarium. The cowpea was in Virginia by at least 1666, and Florida by around 1700.

The hard labor of enslaved peoples ensured that the black-eyed pea or cowpea was grown and cultivated as a crop largely for livestock throughout the United States, most especially in the South. Black-eyed peas were also a fixture in gardens of enslaved peoples, these beans a hearty supplement to the meagre meals allotted on plantations. The cowpea became “the third most important food crop produced on Carolina plantations between 1730 and 1776.”* <span eid="Q11812"> Thomas Jefferson </span> and <span eid="Q23"> George Washington </span> both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, and Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about growth and cultivation of the plant, which in a [letter of 1787](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-05-02-0442) he calls "small, and round black eyed Pease called the Gentlemans Pea". By the nineteenth century black-eyed peas achieved new cultural cache and graced the tables of the white ruling class. Enslaved cooks played an important role in bringing this food into rarefied homes.

## Subtitle

Throughout the <span eid="Q8676"> Civil War </span>, cowpeas remained an important food for all people throughout the U.S. In the late nineteenth century, American <span eid="Q2787508"> subsistence farmers </span> were encouraged to grow cowpea even if their local climate meant they didn’t get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the US farming landscape. A 'Farmers Bulletin' of 1920 gave specific official advice on [growing cowpeas](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiOMV1jWGiQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true) in the US. Cowpea was, and still is, mainly grown in southern hotter states and California, as the warm, dry conditions are more favourable for bean production there.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, in Japan, a copy of the extraordinary 30-volume agricultural encyclopaedia _Seikei Zuetsu_ (written 1793-1804) was gifted to the German physician, botanist and plant collector <span eid="Q77140">Philipp von Siebold</span> in the 1820s. Siebold arrived in Nagasaki in 1823 and started a medical school there, but spent much of his spare time studying Japanese flora and creating his own botanical garden of Japanese plants.[ref] The _Seikei Zuetsu_ detailed 109 crops of southern Japan and inside its beautifully illustrated pages can be found the 'cowpea' – most probably showing _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp. _unguiculata_ cv.-gr. _sesquipedalis_ or the 'yard-long bean' which was and still is popular in Asia today.[ref] Its presence in this Japanese book of crops from 1800 shows how far the black-eyed pea had come and how its usefulness had been welcomed into many agricultural traditions.

Today, cowpeas are grown commerically in at least 33 countries,* this widespread embrace of the bean uniting geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures. As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out, “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories. Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is fundamental to any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.

## Cross-Cultural Celebrations
In the American South, the vibrant legacies of African culinary traditions preserved by enslaved peoples and their descendants define the region’s cuisine and have inspired countless delicious variations of black-eyed pea-based dishes. That recipe books such as the _Southern Heritage Vegetables Cookbook_ have entire sections dedicated solely to pea recipes, in this case - eight of them black-eyed, speaks to their primacy. They are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory beans and rice dishes.

Black-eyed peas are perhaps most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s. <span eid="Q1763911"> Hoppin’ John </span> is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity for the New Year. It is often served with greens to symbolize wealth and is an absolute must for any southern New Year’s celebration. Brazil’s national dish, <span eid="Q878189"> feijoada completa </span>, has a similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed feijoada “out of scarcity and poverty” made with the black-eyed peas used to feed plantation livestock boiled with discarded pork. Today, however, it is a special and celebratory meal for every level of society, “which requires multiple days to prepare and, served with rice and greens, constitutes an entire meal.” In both cases of the Hoppin’ John and feijoada completa, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, a transformation so tied to Twitty’s concept of identity cooking that it deserves a narrative of its own.

## A Colonial Crop
Although black-eyed pea was not grown as a crop in Britain (it being far too cold and wet), its inclusion in the [Economic Botany Collection](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/collections/economic-botany-collection) of the <span eid="Q18748726"> Royal Botanic Gardens Kew </span> is telling.  Here, over a hundred different collections of [seeds](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/main_image.php?imageid=EBC_68901), pods, ‘fibre’ and even a [model](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/read_ecbot.php?catno=61536&search_term=vigna%20unguiculata&search_type=name&imagechecklist=Images) of cowpea are kept, mean that it was obviously studied as a useful colonial crop plant. Donations are as diverse as from Nigeria, India, Laos, China and Japan, but also from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed such as the <span eid="Q5148408"> Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 </span>, the Japan/British Exhibition of 1910, the British Industries Fair of 1930, as well as the <span eid="Q10534945"> India Museum </span>, the Imperial Institute, the Jamaica Agricultural Society, and colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567"> Dr WB Baikie's </span> Niger Expedition of 1859. One undated individual collection was even donated by the HRH the Prince of Wales, from the ‘East Indies’.

## Modern production
Today, worldwide production of black-eyed peas or cowpeas is hard to estimate as cultivation is still mainly in the hands of small-holder farmers, but also because they are such a staple food that most harvests are used locally rather than being exported. The centres of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s cowpea crop.[^ref ] It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in many different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains such as sorghum and millet or rice.[ref] It is the third most important pulse worldwide, an important element of sustainable agriculture, and feeds hundreds of millions of people.[^ref ]

## A food of the future 
The black-eyed pea or cowpea is an often-overlooked crop, but soon we may all be more familiar with it. Legumes are emerging as ‘foods of the future’ due to their very nature of being highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow. They will play an important part in future food security – providing food in a changing climate and will continue to help small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger and improve their livelihoods. As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, and as more people aim to eat less meat, legume crops such as cowpeas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.[ref]

In this pursuit of a meatless diet, black-eyed peas and other legumes are being increasingly utilized as health foods in the growing diet culture and increasing veganism of the West. Some health-focused cookbooks are regional, aiming to transform, for example, traditional southern recipes like black-eyed peas with pork to leaner, lower-sodium alternatives. Others combine recipes across many cultures, like _The Great Vegan Bean Book_, which aims to give vegans more options for flavorful meatless protein. These types of recipe books often marry recipes inspired by the American South with Indian, African, and Caribbean cuisines.

## Crop wild relatives
Even though the cowpea is considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic. Crop breeding can try to alleviate future potential issues and make the cowpea even more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015"> relatives </span> of the cowpea may hold genes or genetic traits that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions, and perhaps be more pest-resistant.[^ref  ] If these traits can be bred into commercial varieties then the cowpea may be one of the answers to the many agricultural challenges of the future. Over recent decades significant resources have been put into researching the cowpea and its potential. The Crop Wild Relatives Project is one such project aiming to do just that in partnership with 33 countries [^ref ] and global seed banks, including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and <span eid="Q2603353"> Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank </span>. There are currently eleven primary wild relatives of the cowpea are being researched. Southern and western Africa are hotspots for wild cowpea genetic variation. The importance of such relatives demonstrates how vital it is to protect wild plants and wild habitats for the future. In a telling [quote](https://www.cwrdiversity.org/cowpea/) from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be _an unfailing friend_ even while the climate crisis is affecting production.”
